About Adult Dataset:
 Adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below $50,000 per year based on personal details such as relationship and education level. 
 There are many more cases of incomes less than $50K than above $50K, although the skew is not severe.
 The dataset provides 14 input variables that are a mixture of categorical, ordinal, and numerical data types. The complete list of variables is as follows:

Age.
Workclass.
Final Weight.
Education.
Education Number of Years.
Marital-status.
Occupation.
Relationship.
Race.
Sex.

Capital-loss.
